<p>The distinctive feature of the top covers made of artificial quartz stone is its high durability to external influences. Unlike artificial acrylic stone, artificial quartz stone contains up to 90 percent of natural quartz - one of the strongest natural
    materials. The stainless-steel design provides an easier installation of additional equipment.</p>

<p>The increased passage width allows organizing an additional emergency exit and access for people with reduced mobility. When passing, the turnstile swing panels open.</p>
<p>It is possible to install STD-11 central section to increase the number of passage zones. Each central section allows organizing an extra passage zone.</p>
<p>The tracking system is equipped with two levels of infrared sensors with 24 pairs located on the upper level and the other 24 on the lower level of the turnstile, which guarantees safety and high throughput rate, and prevents tailgating.</p>
<p>The (open/closed) turnstile indication is located on the central indication blocks above the swing panel drives, and on the front ends of the artificial stone top covers (the indication on stainless steel covers is not provided by design). It is possible
    to install readers under the post top covers.</p>
<p>Bei Notentriegelung oder Stromabschaltung werden die Flügel entriegelt.</p>
<p>The swing panels unlock upon receiving an emergency signal or in case of a power loss.</p>
<p>The turnstile can be a part of an ACS as an operating device or a standalone unit controlled by RC-panel or WRC. The RC-panel is included in the standard delivery set.</p>
