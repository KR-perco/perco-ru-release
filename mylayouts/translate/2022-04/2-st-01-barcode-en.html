    The increased passage width allows organizing an additional emergency exit and access for people with reduced mobility. When passing, the turnstile swing panels open.
</p>
<p>
    It is possible to install STD-11 central section to increase the number of passage zones. Each central section allows organizing an extra passage zone.
</p>
<p>
    The tracking system is equipped with two levels of infrared sensors with 14 pairs located on the upper level and the other 28 on the lower level of the turnstile, which guarantees safety, high throughput, and prevents tailgating.
</p>
<p>
    The passage direction indicators are located on the front ends of the turnstile posts. The turnstile state indicators (open/closed) are located on the post top covers.
</p>
<p>
    The swing panels open upon receiving an emergency unblocking signal providing free passage in both directions. In case of a power loss, the swing panels unlock.
