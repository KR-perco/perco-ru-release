<p>Speed gates (the turnstiles with swing or sliding panels) nowadays are confidently leading the global turnstile market, demonstrating sustainable growth. According to the research of the British analytical agency IHS Markit, the market share is expected
    to increase by 7% over the next 5 years.</p>
<p>The market growth of speed gates is due to a number of advantages of this type of turnstiles that best meet today's market demands. These advantages include a convenient touch-free passage, high throughput rate, and easy integration with additional equipment.</p>
<h2>Convenient touch-free passage</h2>
<div class="flex" style="flex-direction: column; justify-content: center;">

    <div style="margin-block-start: 10px;">ST-01 Speed gates, the Mosfilmovsky residential complex, Russia</div>
</div>
<p>If earlier speed gates were installed mainly at the entrance offices of companies, banks, enterprises, now it is a popular solution for residential complexes, university campuses, schools, and even kindergartens.</p>
<p>Compared with tripods and box tripod turnstiles, speed gates provide not only protection from unauthorized access but also touch-free passage, fast emergency exit, and organization of passageways of the required width, thus creating a comfortable environment
    for people with reduced mobility, children, and pet owners.</p>
<p>When receiving an authorization signal, speed gates open automatically. Optical sensors detect the presence of a person in a controlled area and allow preventing “tailgating”. Besides, optical sensors ensure safe passage for children and animals.</p>
<h2>High throughput rate</h2>

    <div style="margin-block-start: 10px;">ST-01 Speed gates, Krasnoyarsk Airport, Russia</div>
</div>
<p>Among all types of turnstiles, speed gates are distinguished by the high throughput rate that allows using this type at public facilities: airports, train stations, stadiums. According to analysts of IHS Markit, the global expansion of the metro system
    in the most densely populated countries of the world in India and China is one of the main drivers of growth in the speed gate market. The active construction of new stations with turnstile installations determines the demand for speed gates, it is
    this type of turnstiles that has the maximum throughput, which allows preventing the formation of queues even upon an intensive flow of passengers. Speed gates are installed at transportation facilities all over the world.</p>
<h2>Easy integration with additional equipment</h2>
<p>The key benefit of speed gates is integration with additional equipment, such as face recognition terminals, controllers, barcode scanners, document recognition terminals.</p>
<p>Nowadays, one of the main trends in the market of access control systems is face recognition. The average annual growth of the market of such systems is estimated by analysts at 20%. Face recognition technology is widely used in such public areas as airports,
    train stations, and stadiums. Recently, face recognition technology has become more in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic and contactless identification.</p>
<p>According to the data from Sita Air Transport IT Insights, 77% of airports and 71% of airlines will test and implement face recognition systems by 2021. Today, such solutions are used at the largest airports in the USA, Australia, Hong Kong, and the Netherlands.
    Speed gates can be supplemented with special brackets for integration with face recognition terminals. To check documents without the participation of employees of the facility, speed gates are equipped with document recognition terminals. </p>

    <img alt=" " src="/images/articles/ekspansiya-skorostnykh-prokhodov-na-mirovom-rynke-turniketov/1.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;">
</div>
<p>Barcode scanning is carried out by scanners installed on special front panels. This solution improves the verification process, the system permits or denies access and opens the turnstile automatically.</p>
<p>The design of stainless-steel covers allows simplifying the integration of speed gates with additional equipment. Such design also increases the durability of turnstile top covers.</p>
<p>Some speed gate models allow installing readers not only on brackets but also under turnstile top covers, other models, for example the ST-02 speed gate, allow embedding both a reader and a controller. The speed gates can be integrated with card capture
    readers at sites with a large flow of visitors and the need to withdraw visitor passes.</p>
